# Sandbox

As the name suggests, this repository is just a sandbox to experiment with code locally; mostly coming in handy when solving puzzles. The [`run.sh`](./run.sh) script will run any file you give it without creating any extra files. For example, it can compile a C file, run the executable and remove object files afterwards.
